# Construction

Construction is your all-in-one solution for efficiently overseeing contractors, coordinating with construction companies, and engaging with shop owners. Simplify project management, streamline communication, and optimize workflows with our intuitive platform tailored specifically for the construction industry.

## Getting Started

To get started with Construction, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK installed on your machine
- Android Studio or Xcode (for iOS development)
- Firebase account (for authentication and other features)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/construction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd construction
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. Add Firebase to your Flutter project by following the instructions provided by Firebase. This usually involves creating a project in the Firebase console and downloading the `google-services.json` file for Android and `GoogleService-Info.plist` file for iOS.

   Once you have obtained the `google-services.json` file, place it in the `android/app` directory of your Flutter project.

### Building the APK

To build the APK for Android, run the following command:

```bash
flutter build apk
```

The generated APK file will be located in the `build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/` directory.

For more information about building APKs in Flutter, refer to the [official documentation](https://flutter.dev/docs/deployment/android).

### Running the App

```bash

This will compile the app and install it on the connected device or emulator.
